| 1    | plotUtils.py | Contains functions to generate plots for data created during or after training and validation of the models. Also includes functions to save training and validation data after every epoch.               |
| 2    | utils.py     | Contains general utility functions (mostly dealing with sequences) used by many scripts, such as fetching sequence from coordinates, extending coordinates, etc.                                        |
